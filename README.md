# 3D_PoseEstimation_Reconstruction-Camera
Contains MATLAB scripts to demonstrate concepts like multiview geometry, camera calibration, decomposition and composition of camera matrices etc.

Contains shell scripts to run existing Structure-from-Motion pipelines for sparse and dense 3D reconstructions. The scripts have been tested on the High Performance Clusters (Superior/Portage) at Michigan Technoloigical University.
